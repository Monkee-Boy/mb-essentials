WordPress plugin featuring basic tweaks and configuration common across our installs. This includes modifications to the admin, removing WP clutter, and settings for common plugins (ACF, Gravity Forms, etc). See readme.txt for more details on features.

### Release

To release a new version to the wordpress.org Plugin Directory; push to the `main` branch, create a new tag with the version number (Ex: `git tag -a 1.1.3 -m "Releasing v1.1.3" && git push origin 1.1.3`), and the GH Action will auto deploy it to the directory. You can verify a successful deploy from the actions panel on the repo or checking the [plugin website](https://wordpress.org/plugins/monkee-boy-wp-essentials/).
